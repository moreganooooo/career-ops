## 1. Problem Statement

ALU is African Leadership University, a network of tertiary
institutions offering undergraduate and graduate programs with a
focus on leadership and entrepreneurship. Founded in 2015 by Fred
Swaniker, it operates residential campuses in Mauritius (originally
the African Leadership College) and in Kigali, Rwanda, alongside
remote and online offerings. Its academic structure includes units
such as the School of Entrepreneurial Leadership, and it uses a
learning-coach model rather than traditional lecturing.

ALU publishes its careers board through Greenhouse at
the bare slug `alu`. The run-398 batch sweep confirmed
32 live role(s) via a direct probe of
`https://api.greenhouse.io/v1/boards/alu/jobs?content=true`.
Sector: Higher Education. HQ: Kigali, Rwanda.

## 2. Goals

- Ship a `source-company-alu` plugin returning live
  `JobPostDto` rows from the Greenhouse board.
- Mirror the canonical variant-2 + D-08 company-direct template
  (wire `company_name` pass-through; defensive title/department
  trim; entity-decode-then-tag-strip descriptions).
- Bundle a unit-test suite (≥ 9 cases) with a mocked HTTP fixture.
- Publish the plugin's `Module` in `ALL_SOURCE_MODULES`.

## 3. Non-Goals

- Authenticated Greenhouse Harvest API support.
- Backfilling historical ALU postings.
- Cross-board enrichment or salary inference.

## 4. User / Caller Stories

> As an **aggregator caller**, I want **`Site.ALU`** in the
> source registry, so that **a single `siteType: [Site.ALU]`
> request returns ALU's open roles**.

## 5. Functional Requirements

| ID    | Requirement                                                                 | Priority |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| FR-1  | Add `Site.ALU = 'alu'` to the `Site` enum.               | must     |
| FR-2  | New plugin package `@ever-jobs/source-company-alu`.                  | must     |
| FR-3  | `AluService.scrape(input)` returns a `JobResponseDto`; never throws. | must   |
| FR-4  | The plugin is registered in `ALL_SOURCE_MODULES`.                          | must     |
| FR-5  | `tsconfig.base.json` path-alias + matching `jest.config.js` mapper.      | must     |
| FR-6  | Each `JobPostDto` `id` prefixed `alu-`, `site === Site.ALU`. | must |
| FR-7  | `input.resultsWanted` honoured.                                           | must     |
| FR-8  | `input.searchTerm` honoured (title + department substring).               | should   |
| FR-9  | Network errors caught — returns `{ jobs: [] }`.                            | must     |
| FR-10 | ≥ 9 unit tests with mocked HTTP.                                            | must     |
| FR-11 | D-08 decode-then-strip pipeline.                                            | must     |
| FR-12 | Wire `absolute_url` flows through to `jobUrl` (variant 2).               | must     |
| FR-13 | D-10 defensive `.trim()` on wire titles.                                   | must     |
| FR-14 | D-11 defensive `.trim()` on wire department names.                         | must     |

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

NFR-1..NFR-4 — same as cohort baseline (no new runtime deps;
`Promise`-based async; `Logger` not `console`; resilient to
malformed payloads).

## 7. Contracts

### 7.1 API / Interface

```ts
@SourcePlugin({ site: Site.ALU, name: 'ALU', category: 'company' })
@Injectable()
export class AluService implements IScraper {
  scrape(input: ScraperInputDto): Promise<JobResponseDto>;
}
```

### 7.2 Errors

All transport errors swallowed; caller sees `{ jobs: [] }`.

## 8. Test Plan

- ≥ 9 cases. Happy-path asserts variant-2 URL pass-through
  (`job-boards.greenhouse.io/alu/jobs/<id>`), wire
  `company_name` pass-through (`'ALU'`),
  D-10 title-trim lock, D-11 department-trim lock, and the
  D-08 decode-then-strip regression guard.
- Plus standard cohort cases (resultsWanted cap, searchTerm
  match + non-match, HTTP 500 error handling, empty payload).

## 9. Open Questions

(none open — see § 10 Decisions.)

## 10. Decisions

- **D-04 (run #398):** Wire-shape variant 2 (canonical hosted-board
  host `job-boards.greenhouse.io/alu/jobs/<id>`).
- **D-08 (run #398):** Decode-then-strip description pipeline.
- **D-09 (run #398):** Wire `company_name` pass-through
  (`'ALU'`).
- **D-10 (run #398):** Defensive `.trim()` on wire titles.
- **D-11 (run #398):** Defensive `.trim()` on wire department names.
